🔭 Currently working as a Lead Developer Unity C# on [Crying Suns](https://cryingsuns.com) and some unannounced projects at [Alt Shift](https://altshift.fr)

🍏 I've been an Apple user for a long time and I am exploring the many frameworks you can find in the Apple ecosystem.

🐘 I'm also an experienced PHP developer _(and probably a little overprotective of our beloved language)_
